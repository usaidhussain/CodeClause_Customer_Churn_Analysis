# Customer Churn Analysis

This repository contains code for performing customer churn analysis using Python and popular data analysis libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Dataset

The analysis is performed on the "Customer-Churn.csv" dataset, which contains information about customers, including their demographic details, services subscribed, payment methods, monthly charges, total charges, and churn status (whether the customer has churned or not).

## Analysis Steps

1. **Importing Libraries**: The analysis requires the following libraries to be imported:
   - pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
   - matplotlib: For data visualization
   - seaborn: For creating more intuitive and visually appealing plots

2. **Reading the Dataset**: The dataset is read into a pandas DataFrame using the `pd.read_csv()` function.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Initial exploration of the dataset can be done using various pandas functions, such as `head()`, `shape`, and `dtypes`, to understand the structure and content of the data.

4. **Churn Rate Calculation**: The churn rate is calculated by counting the number of customers who have churned and dividing it by the total number of customers. The churn rate provides insights into the proportion of customers who have discontinued their services.

5. **Graphical Analysis**: Visualizations are created using matplotlib and seaborn to gain deeper insights into the customer churn patterns. Examples of different types of plots include bar graphs, pie charts, count plots, and violin plots.

## Usage

1. Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:
   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Clone or download this repository.
4. Place the "Customer-Churn.csv" dataset in the same directory as the code files.
5. Run the code files to perform customer churn analysis and generate the desired graphs.
6. Explore and customize the code as per your specific requirements.
